## Description
ArsMatrix is an Processing Project aimed at becoming an interactive installation where people can explore and witness the properties of colors across multiple dimensions. ArsMatrix takes a 2-dimensional images and maps its color-information to a 3-dimensional Matrix, generating a 3D structure unique to each each image.

The animated process and will show the 3D piece growing as the image is being scanned. The user will be able to change color balances and 3D visualization styles and see their changes in real time, hopefully coming to an higher understanding of color in what I hope to be a mesmerizing experience.

I am planning to include a few popularing painting within the application, but I want to implement Goggle+, Instgrams and other APIs in order to make the user choose a picture of his own, or to take a picture through a webcam.

## Link to Prototypes
- [ArsMatrix JS](http://arsmatrix.neocities.org/ "Prototype 01 | JS Applet")

An early javascript test as the visualization techniques were coming into form. Use the GUI on the right to change settings and drag the slider to switch between different paintings, click "Start Mapping" to restart the process.
