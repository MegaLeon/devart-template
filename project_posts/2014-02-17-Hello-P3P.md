Since I will be mainly moving in three dimensions during the developement of this project, I thought it was a good idea to familiarize with the 3D modes in Processing. I started using P3P, whose performance is better than I imagined, altough later I will probably switch to WEBGL when the projet gets ported to processing.js.

After getting a basic primitive vaguely representing a 3D matrix, I tried filling it up with cubes and map their size to 3D perlin noise, just to practice working with 3D arrays.
