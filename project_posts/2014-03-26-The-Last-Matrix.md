So here I am at the end of this trip - It’s a habit of mine to wrap things up a day or two before the actual deadline, and I feel ArsMatrix grew up to become to a satisfying application.

I am happy with my efforts as most of the technique and concepts that I ended up succesfully using in the application were unknown to me beforehand, but that’s nothing I was not expecting - with the constant stream of new tools and technologies we face nowadays, I am going nowhere if I don’t try to step out of my technical comfort zone and reach for new heights, just like I did in the past when I sat down and thought that “this Processing language looks kinda cool, I’m going to play around with it a bit” - The rest is history.

The most satisfying “side effect” of the development process was to witness how ideas breeded more ideas, almost like a good-willed virus that doesn’t  let me sleep during the night. Now I find myself with several ideas about how I could push ArsMatrix further, but also about new projects and I own that to the inspiration my fellow competitors and creative coders gave me by sharing their creations as well. Congratulations to everyone who took part in this great competition - and let’s keep creating cool things.
