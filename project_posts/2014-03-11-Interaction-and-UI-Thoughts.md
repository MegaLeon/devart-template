I've been sketching some ideas to bring the app to a closer level of interaction with the user. People are already able to change the visualization style to the 3D matrix, but I want to implement some levels of interaction related to the image itself as well: Here are some notes I have put down regarding the issue, and some ramblings about a possible UI.

I have noticed that when I remind myself that the project growing to be an interactive installation, I conclude the more is not always better, UI-wise. I have many ideas about the dozens of possible control schemes and interaction modes but I want to avoid confusing the user and cluttering the screen too much, since this experience should be all about the beauty of color.

The "Live mode", where the user paints on screen and see its strokes mapped to 3D space in real time is quite appealing, yet I am wondering about ways to implement it without risking running in the aforementioned problems.
