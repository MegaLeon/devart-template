I think of ArsMatrix as a project made up of several “modular” components to be put together to create an immersive experience, and this leaves me free to brainstorm about the possible evolutions of an interactive installation.

Let’s take the application core: image download from Picasa and analysis process to translate it to the 3D Matrix. The installation would feature a touch panel for the user to interact with. Based on the design choice, I can rearrange the UI on screen and create the illusion of two touch panels by using a physical separation.

My original view of the project was having a dual-sided installation, with the “classic” mode on one side and the “live” mode on the other, where people would be free to play with the painting application. Because of each “module” being totally independent, it would not be hard to feature multiple panels to allow more people to try the installation at once.

I remember my experience when I first visited the Science Museum in London and tried the Google Web Labs experiments. I was pleasantly surprised when I was handed out the data card and loved the feeling of having the experience connected to a physical possession (very materialistic, I know), so I thought of similar ways to feature something similar in ArsMatrix. I imagined an installation where the user, after customizing, can choose to send the matrix to a 3D printer and pick up a very small miniature of the 3D structure he was observing on screen just minutes before from bays on the side of the installation, a memento of the experience to take home and to use as a colorful decoration and to kindle people’s curiosity.

I am not acquainted with the level that 3D printing technology reached nowadays, so I am unsure of how fast the printing process would be in a scenario where many users are interacting with the installation one after another, but when I imagine a very small 3D print and some kind of queue system with multiple 3D printing bays, it does not sound totally unreasonable. 

I am experimenting into getting a coloured mesh exported from processing (right now I am able to export the mesh, although  the color UV coordinates seem wrong) thanks to the ![objexporter](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/tools/obj/ “objexporter”) library, which was developed precisely for 3D printing output from processing. I believe that the step from this to actual 3D printing will not be large at all.
